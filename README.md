# Bandwidth-Enhancement-of-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna-using-Parasitic-Patch
This project on bandwidth enhancement of a microstrip patch antenna using
a parasitic patch on HFSS has shown promising results. By adding a parasitic patch to the
original microstrip patch antenna, the bandwidth of the antenna has been significantly increased.
